Spring MVC
==========

Introduction
------------

We know we need to learn both new and old languages, so why not the most propulatr language of all time - Java and also why not one of the most propular framework.

Platform
--------

I developed this using a Virtual Machine from Bitnami. They did a great job constructing VM for different platform. The one I use is tomcat. mySQL on a ubunta linux, run in VMware Player. Code is developed using Eclipse. Tools I use are Ant, Spring, Vi (for readme markdown). The site are constructed from tutorial of [Spring MVC Step by Step](http://static.springsource.org/docs/Spring-MVC-step-by-step/).


Branch Plan
-----------

I will add Hibernate to the mixes. See whether I can add Mongodb and other stuff.
